# This is a testing folder!
Here we experiment with the language...

## Current usage:
I'll (@somerandomdev49) will explain how languages work to other members of the dev team.

## Running:
To run a single module, go to the parent directory `pum/` and use the command:
```sh
python3 -m testing.<module>
```
You need to do this because otherwise the relative imports don't work.
