# This is a testing folder!
Here we experiment with the language...

## Current usage:
I'll (@somerandomdev49) will explain how languages work to other members of the dev team.

## Order:
1. `lexing.py`
2. `parsing.py`
3. Evaluating, both can be done at the same time.
	1. `evaluating.py`
	2. `compiling/`


## Running:
To run a single module, go to the parent directory `pum/` and use the command:
```sh
python3 -m testing.<module>
```
You need to do this because otherwise the relative imports don't work.
